# PAM & CLARA Repo

This repo is for one of the projects I undertook during my MBA in the Technical University of Crete. 

The project was about the development, from scratch, of the PAM and CLARA algorithms and applying them to a business related topic. 

There are two classes PAM.py and CLARA.py containing the basic functions for the algorithms to run and some extra functions for visualization and cluster evaluations. 

For details into each class check the PAM_docs.md and CLARA_docs.md files. 

Also there are two notebooks, PAM_testing.ipynb for the basic testing of the classes, and also one attempt at applying the algorithms for customer segmentation in PAM_CLARA_RFM_online_shop.ipynb.

The dataset for the RFM application can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hunter0007/ecommerce-dataset-for-predictive-marketing-2023).
